                Mavis AAC is a simple app for interacting with Apple’s built-in speech synthesizer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to replace the built-in Live Speech app with something a bit more capable and user-friendly for those who rely on speech synthesis daily.
            </p>
            <p>
                If available, Mavis can speak using Apple’s Personal Voice as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                For maximum reliability, Mavis AAC is completely offline and requires no Internet connection to function correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mavis AAC works on <a href="/apps/mavis-aac/macos/">MacOS</a> as well as <a href="/apps/mavis-aac/ios/">iPads and iPhones</a>. It is very similar on all platforms, but each version has small tweaks so that Mavis feels better integrated with your device.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the iPad, Mavis AAC has been optimized for use with an external wireless keyboard.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mavis AAC should work all the way back to Big Sur. However, Personal Voice and FaceTime integration only work on Sonoma or newer.

            </h2>
            <p>
                English is a fickle beast, so you can edit the pronunciations of specific words so that it sounds how it should. This is most often useful with proper nouns, names and acronyms.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use this to expand texting shorthand. More information and examples are available in the <a href="help.html#fixing-pronunciations">Fixing Pronunciations section of the Help document</a>.

                Soundbites
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you have done some voice banking, Mavis AAC can play your exact voice from the recordings when you type the exact word or phrase in the soundbite.

                MacOS FaceTime SharePlay Integration

            <p>
                If you are making FaceTime calls on your Mac, you can add the audio generated by Mavis directly into your FaceTime call along with your microphone. The other participants can hear you laugh or make other sounds, but you can quickly speak clearly with your voice synthesizer when you need to.

            <p>
                Download <a href="https://github.com/msolo/Mavis-AAC-MacOS/releases/latest/download/Mavis-AAC.dmg">Mavis-AAC.dmg</a> and run the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mavis AAC will trigger permission requests for <strong>Accessibility Access</strong> and <strong>Personal Voice</strong>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="accessibility-permission">

            <p>
                Mavis AAC will trigger a permission request for Accessibility Access so it can integrate with FaceTime calls.
            </p>
            <img srcset="img/accessibility-access-dialog.webp 2x" alt="Accessibility Dialog" class="center">

                Before Mavis AAC can ask for permission to use your Personal Voice, you must allow applications to even request that permission.
            </p>
            <img srcset="img/personal-voice-preferences.webp 2x" alt="Personal Voice Preferences" class="center">
            <p>
                Make sure this toggle is enabled and restart Mavis AAC. You should now see a request for permission to use your Personal Voice.

            <img srcset="img/personal-voice-permission.webp 2x" alt="Personal Voice Permission" class="center">
