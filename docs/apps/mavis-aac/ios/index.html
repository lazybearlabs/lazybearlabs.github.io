            <p>
                Mavis AAC is a simple app for iPhone and iPad for interacting with Apple’s built-in speech synthesizer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mavis AAC was built to replace the built-in Live Speech app with something a bit more capable and user-friendly for those using speech synthesis daily. On the iPad, Mavis AAC has been optimized for use with an external bluetooth keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                At least one high quality system voice is required to use Mavis AAC and it can use Apple's Personal Voice as well.

                Pronunciations
            </h2>
            <p>
                English is a fickle beast, so you can edit the pronunciations of specific words so that it sounds how it should. This is most often useful with proper nouns, names and acronyms.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Soundbites
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you have done some voice banking, Mavis AAC can play your exact voice from the recordings when you type the exact word or phrase in the soundbite.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Phone/FaceTime Integration
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you are making phone or FaceTime calls on your iPad/iPhone the audio generated by Mavis AAC is automatically sent on the call, even with your microphone active. The other participants can hear you laugh or make other sounds, but you can quickly speak clearly with your voice synthesizer when you need to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soundbites do not work over FaceTime/Phone calls due to some limitations with iOS. When a call is active, soundbites will be synthesized rather than played back from the recordings.
